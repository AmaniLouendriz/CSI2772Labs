monfichier1.cpp + monfichier1.h: takes input from the user and gives data in different notations 

(decimal, octal, hexadecimal, scientific..)

monfichier2.cpp + monfichier2.h: A program that asks the user to calculate either a surface or a volume 

depending on the user choice. It simulates the concept of static variables and control flows.

monfichier3a.cpp: A program that takes an array from the user and sorts it using bubble sort.

It shows the concept of passing by value and sorting algorithm.

monfichier3b.cpp: Same as before, but the array is sent by reference instead of by value.
